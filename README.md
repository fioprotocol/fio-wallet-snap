# FIO Wallet Snap

The FIO Wallet SNAP lets every Metamask user self-custody their FIO identity and gain access to the FIO App without setting up new accounts or passwords. The FIO App lets MetaMask users  register and link their FIO Handle, as well as send and receive FIO Requests and sign NFTs.

## Testing

The snap comes with some basic tests, to demonstrate how to write tests for
snaps. To test the snap, run `yarn test` in this directory. This will use
[`@metamask/snaps-jest`](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/tree/main/packages/snaps-jest)
to run the tests in `src/index.test.ts`.
